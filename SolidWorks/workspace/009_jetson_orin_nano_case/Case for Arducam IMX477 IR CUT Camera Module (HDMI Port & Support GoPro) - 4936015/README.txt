Summary:
This tiny reliable case is for Arducam IMX477 IR CUT Camera Module (Raspberry Pi Version &amp; Jetson Version). It supports HDMI port and GoPro.This Arducam module uses the same 12MP IMX477 image sensor as the Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera but offers a mechanical IR cut-off filter switched automatically based on light conditions. The official RPi HQ camera is not sensitive to infrared, and there won’t be a NoIR version. On the contrary, this Arducam camera module not only offers sensitivity to infrared but also keeps the natural feeling during daylight. It’s fully compatible with all Raspberry Pi models with a camera connector. We released two versions of this camera.Raspberry Pi Version: https://bit.ly/3mbKcfrJetson Version: https://bit.ly/3gf2k4cArducam CSI to HDMI Adapter Board: https://bit.ly/3ATjlIXKnow more about IMX477 image sensor: https://bit.ly/38rcNFpKnow more about Arducam IMX477 camera modules for Raspberry Pi: https://bit.ly/3yv9RSEKnow more about Arducam IMX477 camera modules for Jetson: https://bit.ly/3jwbGKS
